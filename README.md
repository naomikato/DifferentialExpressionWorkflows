# Differential Expression Workflows

Welcome to the **Differential Expression Workflows** repository! This project provides different workflows and analysis notebooks for performing differential gene expression analysis on gene expression data.

## About

The Differential Expression Workflows repository focuses on providing implementation examples for popular differential expression analysis tools, including edgeR, DESeq2, and limma. These workflows allow researchers to identify genes that are differentially expressed between different conditions, such as control and treatment groups.

## Data

The `data` directory contains example data files required for testing the differential expression workflows:

- **control_samples.csv:** Sample information for control group.

- **treatment_samples.csv:** Sample information for treatment group.

- **gene_expression_data.csv:** Simulated gene expression data.

- **annotation_data.csv:** Gene annotation data.

## Workflows

The `workflows` directory includes Python scripts for different differential expression analysis workflows:

- **edgeR_workflow.py:** Workflow for differential expression analysis using edgeR.

- **DESeq2_workflow.py:** Workflow for differential expression analysis using DESeq2.

- **limma_workflow.py:** Workflow for differential expression analysis using limma.

## Results

The `results` directory contains the output files generated during differential expression analysis:

- **edgeR_results.csv:** Results of edgeR analysis.

- **DESeq2_results.csv:** Results of DESeq2 analysis.

- **limma_results.csv:** Results of limma analysis.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating the differential expression analysis using each workflow:

- **edgeR_analysis.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating the edgeR analysis.

- **DESeq2_analysis.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating the DESeq2 analysis.

- **limma_analysis.ipynb:** Notebook demonstrating the limma analysis.

## Usage

To get started, follow the examples and code snippets provided in the workflows and analysis notebooks. Use the example data files in the `data` directory for testing the workflows.

## Contributions
